# What is SDLC
SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle and is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares.The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

# What are the phases in SDLC
 - Requirements (Planning)
 - Analysis
 - Design
 - Implementation (Coding)
 - Testing and Integration
 - Deployment (Acceptance)
 - Maintenance

 # What are SDLC models
 - waterfall
 - Agile
 - Spiral model
 - V model
 - Devops

## Waterfall model

#### Disadvantages of waterfallmodel
- It is difficult to estimate time and cost for each phase of the development process. 
- Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage. 
- Not a good model for complex and object- oriented projects. 
- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. 

### Agile model
Most widely used and highly successful model.

Agile development model is also a type of Incremental model. Software is developed   
in incremental, rapid cycles. This results in small incremental releases with each release building on previous functionality.  Each release is thoroughly tested to ensure software quality is maintained.

Agile software development method emphasis on iterative, incremental, and evolutionary development.

# What is devops
DevOps is a methodology that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team. This allows deploying code to production faster and in an automated way. It helps to enables rapid deployment of products.
